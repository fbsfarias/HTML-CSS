<body>
    <p>You can write a paragraph in any way. Just put everything in the middle of p and /p tag pair. Also the &lt; and &gt; can be created by & lt and & gt (less than and greater than).
    </p>
    <p>If you need to break the text at some specific place <br> like this, you can use the &lt; br &gt; tag. </p>
    <p>Let's add some special symbols:

            &reg;
            &copy;
            &euro;
            &pound;

            &cent;
